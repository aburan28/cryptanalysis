/*
 * ecc2k130.h - the golden model for the ECC2K-130 rho core.
 *
 * This is the reference the RTL is checked against, the generator of its test
 * vectors, and the host-side twin that replays what the hardware reports.
 * One implementation of the arithmetic, used by all three, so that "the
 * hardware agrees with the model" and "the host agrees with the hardware"
 * cannot drift apart into two different claims.
 *
 * The curve is the Certicom ECC2K-130 challenge curve
 *
 *     E : y^2 + x y = x^3 + 1     over  F_{2^131}
 *
 * whose group order is 4 * n with n = 680564733841876926932320129493409985129
 * prime (~2^129).  That is derived rather than quoted: E_0(F_2) has 4 points,
 * so the Frobenius trace is t = -1, and the Koblitz recursion
 * s_m = t*s_{m-1} - 2*s_{m-2} gives #E(F_{2^131}) = 2^131 + 1 - s_131; see
 * README.md.
 *
 * FIELD REPRESENTATION.  F_{2^131} is carried in a type-II optimal normal
 * basis, which exists because 2*131+1 = 263 is prime and 2 has order 131
 * modulo 263, so 2 generates the quadratic residues.  With gamma a primitive
 * 263rd root of unity the basis is
 *
 *     beta_i = gamma^i + gamma^-i,   i = 1 .. 131
 *
 * and an element is a 131-bit coefficient vector.  Three properties make this
 * the right basis for the hardware, and all three are checked in the test:
 *
 *   - beta_i * beta_j = beta_{i+j} + beta_{i-j}, with indices folded by
 *     beta_{263-k} = beta_k and beta_0 = 0.  So a product is a cyclic
 *     convolution of two symmetric 263-vectors: regular, shift-and-xor, and
 *     exactly what a digit-serial multiplier does in hardware.
 *   - Squaring maps beta_i to beta_{2i mod 263}: a fixed permutation of the
 *     coefficients, which is free in hardware (it is wiring) and is why the
 *     Frobenius endomorphism this attack is built on costs nothing.
 *   - The normal-basis coefficient order is a permutation of this index
 *     order, so the Hamming weight is the same in both.  The iteration
 *     function and the distinguished-point test are defined on the
 *     normal-basis weight, and this is why they can be evaluated directly on
 *     the vector the hardware holds, with no conversion.
 *
 * THE WALK.  The iteration of Bailey et al., "Breaking ECC2K-130":
 *
 *     j = ((HW(x_R) >> 1) & 7) + 3 ;   R' = sigma^j(R) + R
 *
 * with sigma the Frobenius (x, y) -> (x^2, y^2).  A point is distinguished
 * when HW(x) <= 34.  Only x is reported: on a Koblitz curve -(x, y) =
 * (x, x + y), so x is already the negation-class invariant, and the
 * Frobenius class is normalised host-side by taking the minimum x over the
 * orbit (ec2k_orbit_min), which is cheap there and expensive in gates.
 *
 * No coefficients are tracked.  A walk is identified by its seed, and a
 * collision is resolved by replaying both walks from their seeds -- the same
 * trade every ECC2K-130 implementation makes, because tracking (a, b) would
 * double the state and the bandwidth for something needed once per campaign.
