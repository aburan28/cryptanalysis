/*
 * ca_rho.h - Pollard rho with r-adding walks, distinguished points and
 * van Oorschot-Wiener parallel collision search.
 *
 * Solves x * base == target in a cyclic group of known order n.  For best
 * results n should be prime (use Pohlig-Hellman first otherwise); the
 * solver still works for composite n as long as the collision equation is
 * solvable, and falls back to verifying all candidate solutions.
 *
 * Elliptic curve groups additionally use the negation map (walk on
 * {P, -P} classes, expected speed-up sqrt(2)) with fruitless-cycle
 * handling (2-cycle look-ahead + windowed cycle detection with escape by
 * doubling), following Bernstein-Lange-Schwabe.
