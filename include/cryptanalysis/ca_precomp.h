/*
 * ca_precomp.h - discrete logarithms with precomputation (Bernstein-Lange
 * "free precomputation").
 *
 * A one-time, group- and base-specific precomputation builds a table of
 * distinguished-point chains.  Every subsequent logarithm to the same base
 * is then solved online in far fewer operations than a from-scratch square
 * root search: with a distinguished-point probability of 2^{-t} and
 * t = round(log2(n)/3),
 *
 *     table size            ~ n^{1/3} chains
 *     precomputation        ~ n^{2/3} group operations
 *     per-target online     ~ n^{1/3} group operations
 *
 * This is a time/precomputation trade-off, not a break: it does not lower
 * the *total* cost of a single isolated logarithm below the sqrt(n) of
 * Pollard rho (the precomputation alone is n^{2/3}).  Its point is that the
 * n^{2/3} is paid once and then amortised over many targets in a fixed
 * group -- the "non-uniform" setting in which the sqrt(n) security of a
 * standardised curve is not the whole story.
 *
 * The walk is a function of the current point only, adding one of r
 * precomputed steps s_i * base.  Precomputation walks start at a_0 * base
 * (a known multiple of base) and store (endpoint, a_0 + accumulated).  An
 * online walk starts at a * base + target and follows the same walk; if it
 * lands on a stored endpoint e * base then e == a' + x (mod ord(base)) and
 * x = e - a' is recovered.  Every recovered x is verified before it is
 * returned, so a 64-bit endpoint-hash collision can only cost a retry, never
 * a wrong answer.
 *
 * Implementation: walk starts use a fixed-base table for `base` (cheaper than
 * generic double-and-add); the precomputation walks W chains at once through
 * one batched field inversion (ca_group_batch_op, a large win on curves) and
 * runs across `threads` workers; an optional Bloom filter aborts a chain the
 * moment it re-enters already-covered ground (paying off when the table is
 * built to over-cover the group); and the table is a sorted array of
 * (fingerprint, exponent) pairs looked up by binary search.
