# Four-point pair claw: complete toy control and n=53/n=83 step cost

This experiment tests a two-color pair-sum distinguished-point walk for an
ordinary four-point relation. At a state (X), a fixed hash selects a color
and a pair of points from a target-independent factor base (F). Color zero
maps to (F_i+F_j); color one maps to (Q-(F_i+F_j)). When two trails first
merge with opposite colors, the two pairs sum to (Q). The witness is checked
with the curve group law. Only distinguished endpoints are retained between
trails; replay recovers the collision predecessors.

This is a group-law search, not a quotient-summation polynomial solver. Its
large-instance cost remains unknown. In particular, a small-base step timing
does not establish relation yield or a sub-(2^{61}) solve at n=83.

## Complete n=23 one-target control

The [run receipt](runs/n23_one_target.json) and [immutable candidate
manifest](candidates/IC1N23Ckb1fb322PDP4clawRCwalkLAgaussTDdirectISO0h549197846e9c.json)
identify the exact type-II normal field, Koblitz curve, prime subgroup,
projected factor base, algorithm, code hashes, workload, and run. The curve
is `EC1N23Ckb1haed91d8afed0`; the candidate is
`IC1N23Ckb1fb322PDP4clawRCwalkLAgaussTDdirectISO0h549197846e9c`.
`fb322` is the **actual 322 distinct subgroup points before folding**. The
signed-Frobenius quotient has seven columns. `ISO0` means no isogeny; the
manifest records `isogeny: "none"`.

Seven verified setup relations from seven queries gave rank seven. The
recovered logs of all seven representative points were replayed against the
generator. On one previously unseen target, the method found a verified
four-point relation, recovered scalar `987654`, and independently replayed
it. The target-dependent online interval was **201.9 ms**, including the
claw walk, relation check, and scalar replay. It used **3,145 main walk
evaluations** and **9,171 group-add API calls** including replay and
verification. Setup took 17,295 main walk evaluations and is recorded
separately. The scalar used to construct the target fixture was outside the
online clock. No paired rho run or speedup is claimed. The measured `R1`
workload and operation vectors are in the receipt; a single field-operation
total is deliberately `null` because the field API categories are nested.

Run and independently check the control:

```sh
./sage -python experiments/koblitz-pair-claw-20260929/run_n23.py
./sage -python experiments/koblitz-pair-claw-20260929/verify.py
```

## Measured step cost on the named n=53 and n=83 curves

[The stage receipt](runs/n53_n83_step_perf.json) uses the exact curve
records and public targets from the existing frozen prefix workloads. The
n=53 curve has cofactor 428; n=83 has cofactor 4. For each curve, the
benchmark deterministically takes the first 128 rational normal-(x)
coordinates of weight at most two, projects by the correct cofactor, and
includes both signs. This gives a **256-point sample base** at each degree.
It is a timing fixture, not a candidate factor base for four-point yield.
Each reported timing is the median of three uninstrumented 2,048-step
chains. Logical field API calls are counted in a separate run.

| Exact curve ID | Sample B | Median Python time per step | Inversions/step | Multiplications/step |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `EC1N53Ckb1hf77aab617904` | 256 | 43.3 µs | 1.497 | 2.994 |
| `EC1N83Ckb1h876c2921cb64` | 256 | 62.2 µs | 1.463 | 2.927 |

The field call ratios vary slightly because point-add exceptional cases
depend on the sampled walk. Squarings and field additions are in the receipt.
The code uses a fixed 48-byte encoding per field coordinate so the same
hash definition works through n=131. The timings are for the repository's
accepted Sage launcher running Python field arithmetic on this host; they
are not machine-independent field-operation counts.

## Conditional n=83 work screen

The [screen](n83_conditional_screen.json) assumes a **hypothetical**, fully
enumerated 4,000,000-point base with full signed-Frobenius orbit size 166.
Neither that base nor its rank yield has been measured. The assumptions give
24,097 folded columns and about 4.41 four-point multisets per uniform
target in expectation. They further suppose that a useful opposite-color
claw costs exactly (sqrt r) walk evaluations and that every verified
relation adds rank. Charging one further search for the target gives

\[
\log_2((24{,}097+1)\sqrt r) = 55.057
\]

**pair-step evaluations**, before constants, misses, rank dependencies,
base construction, replay, memory, and matrix work. For a total budget of
(2^{61}) field operations, all those costs together leave at most **61.5
field operations per pair step** even if every other stage were free. No
conversion of the measured inversions into field-operation equivalents has
been established. Reusing the small-base n=83 Python step time would imply
about **74,000 one-core years**, a wall-time illustration whose cache
behavior and search law are unvalidated at a four-million-point base.

The screen keeps `candidate_id`, actual B, actual columns, relation yield,
and complete-work exponent `null`, and `verified_n83_dlp` is false. It does
not promote a stage benchmark or a conditional extrapolation to a result.
An exact n=83 candidate needs a frozen enumerated base and signed-Frobenius
column count, measured ordinary-query yield including failures, rank per
query, a verified previously unseen target DLP, and complete operation
accounting. Those are the next gates for this line.
